My project using GPT-4 and RAG 
Prompt Engineering + RAG Learning Journey

This repository tracks my progress as I learn Prompt Engineering and build a GPT-4-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot.

## Week 1

- ✅ Created GitHub, Colab, and Notion accounts
- ✅ Learned what Prompt Engineering and RAG mean
- ✅ Tested my first prompt in ChatGPT
- ✅ Prepared a Colab notebook for future experiments

## Coming Soon:
- Build a working RAG chatbot using LangChain + OpenAI
- Share prompt templates and experiments
- Publish a Notion case study about my project
